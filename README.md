# Kubernetes - Internet of things

## Introduction
This project aims to deepen our knowledge by making us use [K3d](https://k3d.io) and [K3s](https://k3s.io) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

We will learn how to set up a personal virtual machine with Vagrant. 

Then, we will learn how to use K3s and its [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/). 

Last but not least, we will discover K3d that will simplify our life and CI/CD.

These steps will get us started with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

> This project is a minimal introduction to Kubernetes.</br>
> Indeed, this tool is too complex to be mastered in a single subject.

## General guidelines

This project will consist of setting up several environments under specific rules.

It is divided into three parts we have to do in the following order:
- **[`Part 1`](https://github.com/amirmahla/DevOps-Kubernetes/tree/main/p1)**: K3s and Vagrant
- **[`Part 2`](https://github.com/amirmahla/DevOps-Kubernetes/tree/main/p2)**: K3s and three simple applications
- **[`Part 3`](https://github.com/amirmahla/DevOps-Kubernetes/tree/main/p3)**: K3d and Argo CD
- **[`Part 4`](https://github.com/amirmahla/DevOps-Kubernetes/tree/main/p4)**: K3d and Argo CD and Gitlab
